# Decentralized Stablecoin Project

## Introduction

Hello, I'm Andrei Yazepchyk, an aspiring developer currently learning Solidity and exploring the world of blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi). This project is a part of my learning journey, crafted under the guidance of Patrick Collins' comprehensive guide on building DeFi applications.

### Project Overview

The core of this project is a decentralized stablecoin system, designed to be algorithmic and pegged to 1 US dollar, offering a unique blend of stability and decentralization. Backed by exogenous collateral in the form of WETH (Wrapped Ethereum) and WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin), the system allows users to deposit collateral, mint stablecoins, and engage in the liquidation of accounts with low health factors while earning a 10% bonus.

Key features of this project include:

- **Dollar-Pegged Stablecoin**: The stablecoin is algorithmically pegged to 1 US dollar, ensuring stability in its value.
- **Algorithmic and Decentralized**: The coin's value is maintained through algorithmic processes, ensuring a high degree of decentralization.
- **Exogenous Collateral (WETH and WBTC)**: Users can deposit WETH and WBTC as collateral, which are popular and widely recognized cryptocurrencies.
- **Liquidation Mechanism**: The system includes a feature to liquidate users with low health factors, offering a 10% bonus for successful liquidations.
- **Chainlink Price Feeds**: Integration with Chainlink's decentralized oracle networks to obtain accurate and real-time price feeds for WETH and WBTC.
- **Deployment Script**: A tailored deployment script has been created to facilitate the seamless deployment of the contract to a blockchain network.
- **Comprehensive Testing Suite**: The project includes an extensive testing suite, featuring fuzz testing to ensure robustness and reliability of the smart contracts.

### Learning and Development

This project has been an incredible learning experience, delving into the complexities of DeFi applications, stablecoin mechanisms, and smart contract development. It's a testament to the power of guided learning and the effectiveness of hands-on project development in understanding new technologies.
